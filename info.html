           <h1>PRINCIPLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
               <P>
                The seven principles of art and design in photography; balance, rhythm, pattern, emphasis,
                 contrast, unity and movement, form the foundation of visual arts. Using the seven principles
                 allows you to take greater control of your photographic practice. 
                This will lead to better photos and more photographic opportunities.
               </P>
